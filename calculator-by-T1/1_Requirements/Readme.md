# Requirements
## Introduction
 A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere

## Defining Our System
    our system do all arithmetic operations,and it calculates square root ,power ,cube ,factorial and it can able to convert a value from degree to radians and degree to radians
     as well.
